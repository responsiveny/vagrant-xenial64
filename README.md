# vagrant-xenial64
Vagrantfile and provisioning shell script for Ubuntu Xenial 16.04 LTS x64

This is an example of a work-in-progress Vagrant box used for local development of LAMP on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS xenial x64. There were quite a few little workarounds I had to figure out so I hope this serves as a good basis for your project.

php7 is installed here.
